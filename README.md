# HandGestureBrightnessControl
This project is a real-time hand gesture recognition system that adjusts screen brightness based on the distance between the thumb and index finger tips. Using a webcam and the MediaPipe library for hand tracking, the system detects hand landmarks, calculates the distance between the thumb and index finger, and adjusts the screen brightness accordingly through the screen-brightness-control library. The live feed, including hand landmarks and brightness information, is displayed using OpenCV.
